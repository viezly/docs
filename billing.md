# Billing

We **don't charge** for amount of pull requests, reviews, repositories.
The only setting which counts is **number of developers** who contribute to private repositories where Viezly is installed.  


We provide several [plans](#plans) which should fit most of the teams. 
Check out our [plan configuration guide](#plan-configuration).

!> If you don't select a plan Viezly will stop pull-request processing after the trial period.


## Plan configuration

> Configuration is required only for paid plans.
> *Open Source* and *Personal Usage* plans are configured automatically.

> Plan configuration is available only for admin - a person who installed Viezly to repositories.

To configure the pricing plan go to [Viezly dashboard](https://viezly.com/dashboard) page:

![dashboard page](_media/plan_configuration/dashboard_page.png ':size=700')

Press *Project plan* button near the organization you want to select plan for.  
You should be navigated to project plan page:

![dashboard page](_media/plan_configuration/org_plan_page.png ':size=700')

At project plan page you can see active plan, the amount paid per month and date of the payment, trial days left.

Choose a plan.  
You will be asked for credit card and other details required by payment system. We don't store that data.  
After that you will be charged by subscription amount monthly.

That's it! Configuration finished. Enjoy!
