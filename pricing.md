# Pricing

We **don't charge** for amount of pull requests, reviews, repositories.
The only setting which counts is **number of developers** who contribute to private repositories where Viezly is installed.  


We provide several [packages](packages.md) which should fit most of the teams. 
Check out our [package configuration guide](package_configuration.md).

> If you don't select a package Viezly will stop pull-request processing after the trial period.

> We charge clients by issuing an invoice through Payoneer to admin email.
