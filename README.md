# Introduction

Viezly is the code-review tool with visualization at its core.

## How Viezly can help me?

Viezly provides a number of unique features which help you to review pull requests.  
The most significant of them are:
- visualization 
- dependencies between changed files
- splitting big pull requests into a subset of smaller parts 
- handy and meaningful navigation across changed files

Of course, we support all basic features required to perform a code review: comments, review submission, and much more.
