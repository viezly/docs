# Elements

All elements of a diagram can be divided in 3 groups:
- files
- folders
- relations

## Files

A new file:  
![added file](_media/elements/added_file.png ':size=150')

Changed file:  
![changed file](_media/elements/changed_file.png ':size=150')

Removed file:  
![removed file](_media/elements/removed_file.png ':size=150')

File isn't changed:  
![non-changed file](_media/elements/existing_file.png ':size=150')

## Folders

TBD

## Relations

A relation between files is either an import (e.g. JS) or the entity, declared in one file, being used in another file 
(e.g. class declared in one file is used in another file).  
The relations between files are represented as the arrows of appropriate color.

New relation between files:  
![new relation](_media/elements/added_relation.png ':size=150')

Removed relation between files:  
![removed relation](_media/elements/removed_relation.png ':size=150')

Existing relation between files:  
![existing relation](_media/elements/existing_relation.png ':size=150')
